That&rsquo;s why our comments sections are often as helpful as the reviews themselves. </p>\n<p>Our community managers, Erin Price and Janet Towle, wanted to share some of the ways our readers have improved our work recently. Here are some reader questions, suggestions, and corrections that spurred fixes to our reviews:</p>\n<p><strong>In our review of <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-portable-power-stations/\">portable power stations</a>, a commenter noticed a discrepancy between the stated capacity of these giant batteries and our test results. We consulted with an electrical engineer and discovered we had miscalculated the power factor of a fan. We adjusted said test results, and thankfully no picks were affected. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"alignright\"><em>&mdash;With gratitude to <a href=\"http://disq.us/p/20m9ac4\" target=\"_blank\">Randy</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>A reader emailed to say that in our list of <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/lists/upgrades-wed-make-to-any-bathroom/\">upgrades we&rsquo;d make to any bathroom</a>, the price of one of our recommended shelves was showing up as $4,338,870. Not exactly a deal. We discovered that it was due to an issue with how the information gets relayed to our buying buttons. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"alignright\"><em>&mdash;With gratitude to Caleb</em></p>\n<p><strong>Several commenters alerted us to the fact that the top pick in our guide to <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dry-food-storage-containers/\">dry food storage containers</a>, the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/17942/0/4/94024/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rubbermaid Modular</a> line, was discontinued.

Sam Sifton&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018025-sourdough-pancake-or-waffle-batter\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times recipe</a> is a classic. (The New York Times is Wirecutter&rsquo;s parent company.) But I&rsquo;ve also had great success with <a href=\"https://www.theperfectloaf.com/my-top-3-leftover-sourdough-starter-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\">The Perfect Loaf&rsquo;s recipe</a>. I made some of the pancake batter, which calls for a half-hour rise versus an overnight resting period, and I added the rising agents (baking soda, baking powder, and salt) right before cooking to maximize the rise. I cooked them (very quickly) in our budget <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-waffle-maker/\">waffle iron</a> pick, the amazingly inexpensive <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/8634/0/4/94028/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic</a>, which I&rsquo;ve been using for six years running now. </p>\n<h2>New this week</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-rear-bike-rack/\">The Best Rear Bike Rack</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 20</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/our-favorite-kids-beachwear/\">Our Favorite Kids Beachwear</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 20</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/fathers-day-gifts-your-dad-will-love/\">Father&rsquo;s Day Gifts Your Dad Will Love</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 20</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/streaming-tv-may-not-be-the-cable-replacement-you-hoped-for/\">Streaming TV May Not Be the Cable Replacement You Hoped For</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 20</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/leesa-mattress/\">Leesa Mattress Review: An Honest Assessment</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 21</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/saatva-mattress/\">Saatva Mattress Reviews: An Honest Assessment</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 21</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/cold-brew-coffee-makers-diy/\">Iced Coffee at Home: Cold-Brew Coffee Makers vs. DIY</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 21</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smart-sprinkler-controller/\">The Best Smart Sprinkler Controller</a></strong><br>\nUpdated May 22</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-ukulele-for-beginners/\">The Best Ukulele for Beginners</a></strong><br>\nUpdated May 22</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bike-basket/\">The Best Bike Basket</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 23</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/purple-mattress/\">Purple Mattress Review: An Honest Assessment</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 23</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/tuft-needle-mattress/\">Tuft &amp; Needle Mattress Review: An Honest Assessment</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 23</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/money/credit-cards/financing-a-mattress/\">Is Financing a Mattress Worth It?</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 23</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/rei-anniversary-memorial-day-sale-2019/\">Deals We Love From REI&rsquo;s Anniversary Sale 2019</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 24</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-gaming-laptop/\">The Best Gaming Laptop</a></strong><br>\nUpdated May 24</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/money/credit-cards/uber-visa-card-review/\">Uber Visa Card Review: Is 4% Back on Dining Too Good to Be True?</a></strong><br>\nPublished May 24</p>\n<h2>Things we&rsquo;ve been enjoying lately</h2>\n<p><em>Some good listening, watching, and reading you may like</em></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-underrated-pleasures-of-eating-dinner-early\" target=\"_blank\">The Underrated Pleasures of Eating Dinner Early</a> [The New Yorker]</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no bad time of day to eat!

A portable power station is essentially a giant battery with built-in standard AC outlets (unlike a generator, it doesn&rsquo;t need gas and doesn&rsquo;t emit any fumes). It&rsquo;s perfect for tailgating, powering lights and other gear on a camping trip, or keeping in your home for an emergency. As our review notes, the Goal Zero Yeti 1000 offers 950 watt-hours, so it provides the best value for its price. It&rsquo;s usually over $1,000, but right now it&rsquo;s down to $825 with store pickup at your local REI.</p>\n\n\t<figure id=\"attachment_94335\" class=\"wp-caption \">\n\t\t<div class=\"chapter__arp-image\"><img alt=\"A Goal Zero Yeti 1400 WiFi sitting on a counter\" width=\"636\" height=\"424\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-94335 lazyload image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" data-src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869.jpg\" src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869-120x80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869.jpg 636w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869-630x420.jpg 630w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869-570x380.jpg 570w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869-330x220.jpg 330w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869-200x134.jpg 200w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portablepowerbanks-lowres-0869-120x80.jpg 120w\"></div>\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n\t\t\t<!-- -->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit\"> Photo: Sarah Kobos</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n\n\t\n<p><a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/32649/0/4/94047/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Goal Zero Yeti 1400 WiFi</a></p>\n<p>Street price: $1,800<br>\n<strong>Deal price: $1,350 with in-store pickup</strong></p>\n<p>This is also the first sale we&rsquo;ve posted on the Goal Zero Yeti 1400 WiFi, the upgrade pick in our guide to <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-portable-power-stations/#upgrade-pick-goal-zero-yeti-1400-wifi\">the best portable power stations</a>. By far the most powerful model we tested, it nearly doubles the output of our top pick, offering 1,330 watt-hours compared with 950.

If you&rsquo;d like to receive this in your inbox, subscribe <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/wirecutter/wcblog\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This weekend is the series finale of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/arts/game-of-thrones.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, the only series that has managed to bring my friends together one night a week to share eats and gasps. I&rsquo;ll miss our weekly get-togethers even more than I&rsquo;ll miss watching the characters die off one by one. </p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s almost summer, and that means outdoor movie season, and I love <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/lists/everything-you-need-for-a-backyard-movie-night/\">the list</a> that senior editor Grant Clauser has put together to encourage gatherings once <em>GoT</em> ends. Start with a great projector like the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/31218/0/4/93775/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BenQ MH535FHD</a> we recommend, which offers bright output and best-in-class contrast ratio (which means you&rsquo;ll see more than just smudges when you&rsquo;re watching even <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/game-of-thrones-season-8-how-to-adjust-your-tv-for-a-cinematic-picture/\" target=\"_blank\">the darkest battle scenes</a>). Pair that with a standalone projector screen like the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/32467/0/4/93776/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Apex Projector Screen 144HD</a>, which comes in several sizes for a theater-like experience.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-speaker/\">portable audio</a> that will travel far enough for an open backyard, we recommend the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/29407/0/4/93777/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Tribit 360&deg; Sound Speaker</a>, which you can pair for stereo sound and which can run on a single charge for more than nine hours. And although you could ask friends to bring picnic blankets, such as our favorite, the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/13858/1069751/4/93780/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nemo Victory Blanket</a>, consider comfortable folding chairs like the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/16109/0/4/93778/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Coleman Oversized Quad Chair With Cooler</a> and the smaller <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/16125/0/4/93779/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">REI Camp Chair for Kids</a> from our <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-portable-outdoor-chairs/%20\">best portable outdoor chairs guide</a>.  </p>\n<p>Not sure what to show? Start with The New York Times&rsquo;s list of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/arts/television/best-movies-on-netflix.html\" target=\"_blank\">the 50 best movies on Netflix right now</a>&mdash;go for something kid-friendly like <em>Coco</em> or <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> if you have younger neighbors within earshot. For snacks, I recommend popcorn topped with my favorite seasoning mix: onion salt, dried dill, and a huge pile of nutritional yeast (sounds weird, tastes awesome). </p>\n<p>For our full list of movie-night gear, check out &ldquo;<a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/lists/everything-you-need-for-a-backyard-movie-night/\">Everything You Need for a Backyard Movie Night</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>New this week</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-android-phone/\">The Best Android Phones</a></strong><br>\nUpdated May 13</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/kitchen-tools-make-cooking-easier/\">Want to Make Cooking Easier?

Although they promote themselves as cable replacements, none of them exactly replicate the experience of a cable or satellite subscription. In some ways, that&rsquo;s a good thing&mdash;but streaming TV brings its own set of frustrations, too.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve already done an article about <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/how-to-cut-the-cord-and-what-to-do-if-you-cant/\">cutting the cord</a>&mdash;that is, choosing to cancel your cable or satellite service and to get your shows through streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. Those video-on-demand (VOD) services let you watch what you want, whenever you want, so they&rsquo;re great for binge-watching, trying out new shows, or catching a previously aired episode. </p>\n<p>But if you still want to enjoy live TV&mdash;to see <em>This Is Us</em> or <em>Doctor Who</em> right when it airs, to watch college football on Saturday afternoon, or to catch the nightly news&mdash;the VOD approach doesn&rsquo;t cut it. An over-the-air antenna can tune in local live channels like ABC, CBS, and NBC, but not cable channels like BBC America, ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA, and the rest.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s where a streaming TV package comes into play. It&rsquo;s a construct similar to a cable or satellite package, only instead of relying on a rented set-top box to deliver your content, all you need is a Web browser or an app on your smartphone, tablet, <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-media-streamers/\">streaming media player</a>, or <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-lcd-led-tv/\">smart TV</a>.  </p>\n\n\t<aside class=\"inline-recirc\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<ul class=\"recirc-list\">\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"section-posts-list-item js-post-list-item recirc-list-item\">\n\t\t<article class=\"article-group js-article-group\" data-url=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-media-streamers/\" data-title=\"The Best Media Streaming Devices\" data-content-type=\"review\" aria-labelledby=\"group-title-904\" aria-describedby=\"group-text-904\" tabindex=\"0\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-media-streamers/\" class=\"image-link\" role=\"presentation\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/media-streamers-top-3x2-lowres636-1259-120x80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/media-streamers-top-3x2-lowres636-1259-630x420.jpg 630w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/media-streamers-top-3x2-lowres636-1259-570x380.jpg 570w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/media-streamers-top-3x2-lowres636-1259-330x220.jpg 330w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/media-streamers-top-3x2-lowres636-1259-200x134.jpg 200w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/media-streamers-top-3x2-lowres636-1259-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"\" alt=\"The Best Media Streaming Devices\" class=\"lazyload image lazyload image\" data-amp-layout=\"responsive\" role=\"presentation\">\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"group\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a id=\"group-title-904\" class=\"headline-link\" href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-media-streamers/\" aria-label=\"The Best Media Streaming Devices\">The Best Media Streaming Devices</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"group-text-904\" class=\"summary\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The 4K/HDR-friendly <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/21854/0/4/68452/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Roku Streaming Stick+</a> delivers the best selection of apps and services and the best search function in a convenient design.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</article>\n\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</aside>\n\t\n<p>The best-known streaming TV services are <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/19852/0/4/93723/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sling TV</a>, <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/19853/0/4/93725/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">DirecTV Now</a>, <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/23278/0/4/93729/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube TV</a>, <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/23276/0/4/93726/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStation Vue</a>, and <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/23277/0/4/93728/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hulu + Live TV</a>.

Each one seems to fall short in some key way&mdash;the lineup is missing highly coveted channels, the interface is hard to use, the quality is unreliable, or the DVR function is poorly executed. </p>\n<p>Plus, a lot of variables are at play. The &ldquo;best&rdquo; service for you will depend almost entirely on what particular TV channels you want and how much you want to spend, compared with what you can get from cable or satellite providers in your area.</p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote\"><p>We have yet to find a streaming TV service that hits all the right notes in terms of channel offerings, user-friendliness, signal quality, and price.</p></aside>\n<p>The availability of certain channels&mdash;namely, local channels like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox&mdash;varies based on where you live. So do the speed and quality of Internet service. That means the streaming TV experience is not consistent for everyone across the country. </p>\n<p>So, instead of trying to declare a winner, we decided to explore the pros and cons of streaming TV so that you can make an educated decision about whether this approach is right for you.</p>\n<h3>The pros of streaming TV</h3>\n<h4>The starting price can be lower</h4>\n<p>You can get 30-plus live TV channels for $25 per month or less if you go with Sling TV, <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/23280/0/4/93732/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Philo</a>, or <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/32481/0/4/93731/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T WatchTV</a> (this service is actually free for some AT&amp;T Wireless customers). These packages do include more higher-tier channels than you normally get with the most basic cable package but are more limited in terms of local channels and major sports or news networks&mdash;and you may be able to watch your shows on only one device at a time. If you&rsquo;re willing to jump to $45 to $50 per month, you can get a more well-rounded package. Considering that the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/11/15/average-cable-tv-bill-cord-cutting/\" target=\"_blank\">average price of cable or satellite</a> was about $107 in 2018, paying $45 to $50 is still a pretty good deal. </p>\n<h4>More customization options</h4>\n<p>Most of these services allow you to build upon the base package in some way. Many of them let you add premium channels such as HBO and Showtime. Some, like PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now, offer higher-tier packages with a lot more channels. And some, like Sling TV, offer add-on mini-packs of channels geared toward specific interests such as kids programming, sports, or news. It isn&rsquo;t truly &ldquo;&agrave; la carte&rdquo; programming, where you get to pick the exact channels you want, but it is a little more flexible than a giant cable or satellite package with lots of channels you&rsquo;ll never watch.</p>\n<h4>No long-term contracts</h4>\n<p>Most streaming TV services offer a five- or seven-day free trial to test out the service, and all of them allow you to cancel at any time. You&rsquo;re not locked into a long-term contract to get an advertised price, as is usually the case with cable and satellite service. This provides a nice degree of flexibility to audition the different services and add or cancel them as you wish. For instance, I&rsquo;m a huge football fan, so I&rsquo;ll usually subscribe to a streaming TV service in August and then cancel it in February.</p>\n<h4>No equipment rentals</h4>\n<p>With cable or satellite TV, you need at least one primary set-top box in your home (and usually more, if you want service in multiple rooms), and that requires paying monthly rental fees to your provider. Streaming TV does not require any equipment rentals, but you do need to own a device that either has a Web browser or supports the streaming app for the service you choose. Pretty much all of the major services have an app for iOS and Android, as well as the Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, and Roku platforms. You can buy a streaming stick for $50 or less, so it&rsquo;s not too expensive to get your hands on a compatible device if you don&rsquo;t already own one.</p>\n<h4>Watch anywhere</h4>\n<p>Because these services are Internet-based, you can watch your live TV (and recorded shows, if a cloud DVR is included) anywhere in the US where you have a network connection. Depending on the service, there may be some restrictions on what live programming you can watch outside of your home viewing area; this limitation applies mostly to local channels and regional sports networks. Most (but not all) of these services allow you to stream different content to different devices simultaneously, and some even allow you to invite remote family members to share your subscription.</p>\n<h3>The cons of streaming TV</h3>\n<h4>You may not get all of your local channels</h4>\n<p>If you want to watch anything live on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, or The CW, the first thing you need to check is whether a certain service offers those channels in your area. Lower-priced services like Sling TV Orange, AT&amp;T WatchTV, and Philo don&rsquo;t offer local channels anywhere; services like YouTube TV and DirecTV Now offer them almost everywhere, but there are still a few places where you can&rsquo;t get certain channels. You can make up for the absence of local channels with an <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-indoor-hdtv-antenna/\">over-the-air antenna</a> and a TV tuner if you live in a place where you can reliably tune in these stations, but that&rsquo;s more equipment to contend with.</p>\n<h4>DVR functionality varies widely</h4>\n<p>When you use a cable or satellite box with a built-in DVR, you know what to expect. Sure, some are better than others, but the core functionality is the same. You choose shows to record, with the option to do first-run only or repeats. You can set the recording to start early or run late. You can delete things you&rsquo;ve watched or mark how long to keep them. And most important, you can pause, rewind, and fast-forward the recordings, which allows you to skip commercials.</p>\n<p>With streaming TV, the DVR functionality is all over the map. Some services don&rsquo;t offer it, some offer it for an extra fee, and some include it in the base price with unlimited storage. You can&rsquo;t always specify which episodes you want to record or keep, episodes may suddenly become unavailable, some channels may not support pause, rewind, and commercial skip at all, and some providers will replace a recorded episode with an on-demand version (and force you to watch all of the ads in it). Streaming TV DVR functionality gets the job done, but you may not like it as much as your cable or satellite DVR.</p>\n<h4>Prices keep going up</h4>\n<p>Having no long-term contract is great, right? It means you can cancel the service whenever you want. But it also means that the service providers can raise their prices whenever they want&mdash;and that&rsquo;s been happening pretty consistently. As these providers compete to add the most desirable channels, they&rsquo;re forced to raise their rates. All of the major providers have increased their base price at least once since launch. In the past three months alone, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV Now, and FuboTV have all announced price hikes. As the prices continue to tick upward, their value over a lower-tier cable or satellite package grows more questionable.</p>\n<h4>Channel lineups aren&rsquo;t consistent </h4>\n<p>Providers often add channels to their lineup, but they also take away channels. Cable and satellite customers are used to contract disputes that result in the occasional blackout of a channel or group of channels, but sooner or later the two sides work it out and you get your shows back. Streaming TV providers have been known to drop channels with little notice, and those channels may never return.</p>\n<h4>The service performance is tied to your Internet</h4>\n<p>Streaming TV requires high-speed Internet. This may not be a &ldquo;con&rdquo; if you already have fast, reliable, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/05/01/cable-tv-companies-embracing-cord-cutting-higher-cost-streaming/3625265002/\" target=\"_blank\">non-capped Internet service</a>. But if you don&rsquo;t, you may need to upgrade to a better (read: more expensive) Internet and/or cellular plan. Also, if your home Internet service goes down, you could lose your TV signal, too (or at least have to switch to a device with mobile broadband). And even the fastest Internet service sometimes experiences congestion and slowdowns, which may degrade the signal quality.</p>\n<h4>The AV quality isn&rsquo;t as good</h4>\n<p>Many of today&rsquo;s top TV shows are mixed in Dolby Digital 5.1, but streaming TV channels are often limited to stereo sound (with the exception of some on-demand content). The video resolution can vary based on what device you&rsquo;re using to watch the content; it generally maxes out at a 720p resolution, but again it can drop much lower depending on your network&rsquo;s speed and reliability. Some cable and satellite providers now broadcast a limited amount of live programming in 4K, and VOD services like Netflix and Amazon Video offer a lot of TV shows in 4K with Dolby Digital Plus or even Atmos sound (especially their original programming). You don&rsquo;t get that with a streaming TV service.</p>\n<h3>Is a streaming TV package right for you?</h3>\n<p>Have you seen the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hvPj7Uu2Ew\" target=\"_blank\">Sling TV commercials with Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman</a> that play off the idea of being a swinger? That&rsquo;s an apt metaphor to describe the streaming TV customer&mdash;someone who wants the freedom to explore their options, doesn&rsquo;t want to make any long-term commitments, and doesn&rsquo;t mind an experience that&rsquo;s different from the way they&rsquo;ve always done it. You gotta be flexible, man. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re more of a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; type who just wants to make a decision on a TV provider or package, set up some gear, and then hopefully never have to think about it again, a traditional cable or satellite subscription is probably the better way to go. Hardcore sports fans who want access to the most local, regional, and national sports networks are also better off sticking with cable or satellite, although the sports-centric <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/23281/0/4/93733/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">FuboTV</a> streaming service is worth a look.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re still wondering whether to give this streaming TV thing a try, the best thing to do is to make a list of the channels that you (and your family) consider to be must-haves. Then see which services deliver those channels. Do the free trial, cancel at the end, and compare notes. While you have each service, test out the DVR function (if one exists). Explore the interface on every type of device you think you&rsquo;ll use: your phone, your computer, your TV, and so on. No matter how affordable and flexible a service is, if you don&rsquo;t like the way it presents your content, that&rsquo;s the ultimate dealbreaker.</p>\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<p>1.

However, judging from past trends, we believe Prime Day 2019 will fall on a Monday in mid-July this year.</p>\n<p>This will be the fifth Prime Day; Amazon created the first one in 2015 to celebrate the company&rsquo;s 20th anniversary. Now, Prime Day has become an annual 36-hour Black Friday&ndash;in&ndash;July retail event.</p>\n<p>Amazon has never stuck with a fixed date for Prime Day. Last year, the event started at 3 p.m. Eastern on Monday, July 16, but the deals actually began the day before. In 2017, Prime Day fell on July 10, also a Monday. In 2016 and 2015, Prime Day was on a Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.</p>\n<p>Prime Day deals are available only to Amazon Prime members. A membership costs nearly $120 a year, so if you&rsquo;re signing up just to get in on the deals, that up-front cost will negate some of the savings. If you&rsquo;re not already a Prime member, consider whether the benefits of a Prime membership (two-day shipping, Prime Video streaming, unlimited photo storage) will be things you&rsquo;ll likely make use of all year.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never had Prime before, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial. I recommend waiting to do so until Amazon announces the exact date for Prime Day 2019, to make sure your trial will last through the event. Once Prime Day is over, you can cancel before your trial ends and avoid being charged the subscription fee.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "Do You Need a Smart-Home Hub?"
    },
    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>For most people who are interested in setting up smart devices in their home, a dedicated smart-home hub is likely unnecessary. Smart-home hubs act like a go-between for other <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/home-garden/smart-home/\">smart devices</a>&mdash;lights, locks, sensors, thermostats. Until recently they were an essential component for controlling a smart home but that&rsquo;s no longer the case. Digital assistants found in popular smart speakers, like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, are able to perform many of the same tasks as a hub but with far less fuss.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say smart hubs aren&rsquo;t useful for some people. Tinkerers, hobbyists, and power users with the savvy to plan and configure a comprehensive connected home system will find that a hub can add sophisticated capabilities that aren&rsquo;t possible otherwise (see the <a href=\"#if-you-still-think-you-want-a-hub\">If you still think you want a hub</a> section).</p>\n<h3>Why smart home can be confusing</h3>\n<p>At the most basic level, smart (or connected, or Internet of Things) devices are able to interact with other devices and can be controlled remotely. Most consumer-level smart devices rely on a wireless radio signal to link up, both to each other and also with whatever device you use to control them (usually a smartphone). Several wireless systems allow devices to communicate with each other, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ClearConnect, Insteon, Z-Wave, and Zigbee, among others, but they&rsquo;re not compatible with each other. Also, each standard has strengths and weaknesses, such as range, speed, or power consumption.</p>\n<p>In addition to relying on a wireless communication method, many smart devices also integrate with different platforms, like <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-alexa-compatible-smart-home-devices-for-amazon-echo/\">Alexa</a>, <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-google-assistant-compatible-smart-home-devices-for-google-home/\">Google Assistant</a>, and <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/building-a-smart-home-with-apples-homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, which may be exclusive or proprietary. In functional terms, the result is that some smart devices may work exclusively with one flavor of smart-home platform, while others may be compatible with a few. If you were to mosey down the smart-home aisle of a home or electronics store picking up products at random, you would find a good many simply aren&rsquo;t directly compatible with each other. When buying, you need to figure out what works with what.</p>\n<p>Considering all of the variables, you&rsquo;ll quickly discover how building a smart-home system can get tricky fast. That&rsquo;s one reason why smart hubs seem attractive: they consolidate compatibility as well as control among a lot of devices.</p>\n<h3>How smart hubs work</h3>\n<p>A smart hub is essentially a minicomputer tricked out with a bunch of wireless radio transmitters and receivers, all tucked into a tidy box. It connects to your home&rsquo;s network and can act like a go-between, receiving and sending communications back and forth to your other smart devices using whichever of its various wireless radios as needed. And because it&rsquo;s connected to your home Internet network, it allows you to send commands using your smartphone, whether you&rsquo;re at home or away, which is one of the great benefits of smart-home technology.</p>\n<p>Most hubs have their own dedicated smartphone app that lets you organize and arrange your devices as you like: by room, floor, or type. The apps typically have a dashboard that allows for direct control of devices, similar to the buttons of a TV remote&mdash;push an icon to turn on a light bulb, another to lock your door, another brings up a slider to adjust the temperature on your thermostat.</p>\n<p>On a more sophisticated level, hubs also allow you to configure groups of simultaneous controls, what are variously called modes, scenes, or routines, which affect multiple devices at once. This is where the smart stuff really figures in. Modes refer to big-picture statuses, such as home, away, on vacation, or sleeping. You can have devices turn on or off or adjust in a precise way for each of the modes you create. And with a hub you can have those modes trigger automatically using sensors or the location of your phone, or by pushing a button. Similarly, scenes are custom-crafted setups for specific situations. You could create a &ldquo;Good Morning&rdquo; scene that tells your kitchen lights to come on and turn red, your smart speaker to play the first half of Van Halen&rsquo;s seminal <em>1984</em>, the heat to kick on to 72 and all of the window shades to roll up. Routines are more like scheduled or automated scenes: say, when you arrive home the alarm system shuts off, the garage door opens, the front door unlocks, the living room lights come on, and the second half of Van Halen&rsquo;s seminal <em>1984</em> plays in the study.</p>\n<p>Depending on the hub, the array of devices in your arsenal, and the technical chops of the person setting it all up, a fair amount of wizardry is possible. But that&rsquo;s not the realistic case for many people&mdash;hubs require troubleshooting, they fail sometimes or can require customizing code, and the learning curve gets steeper the more you want to do.</p>\n<h3>What you can do without a hub</h3>\n\n\t<figure id=\"attachment_83665\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n\t\t<div class=\"chapter__arp-image\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83665 lazyload image\" alt=\"An Amazon Alexa and a Google Assistant sitting side by side on a yellow metal bookshelf.\" width=\"5748\" height=\"3832\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5748px) 100vw, 5748px\" data-src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278.jpg\" src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-120x80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278.jpg 5748w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-630x420.jpg 630w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-570x380.jpg 570w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-330x220.jpg 330w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-200x134.jpg 200w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/voice-controlled-speaker-fullres-2278-120x80.jpg 120w\"></div>\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n\t\t\t<!-- -->\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit\"> Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n\n\t\n<p>Popular smart devices are becoming more widely compatible with each other, even if they don&rsquo;t communicate over the same wireless standard. Partner programs like Works with Nest and Friends of Hue allow you to link together products from different brands, with much of the technical heavy lifting done in the cloud. The result is that you no longer have to fret over the compatibility of wireless systems like Z-Wave and Zigbee. Cloud-based platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple HomeKit, and IFTTT also allow Internet-connected devices to work together in an essentially seamless way. As a result, you can now connect more device types and have them work together without needing hand-holding from a hub. This is the case for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>Many devices use their Internet connection in the cloud as a place to connect to other authorized devices, which circumvents the need for them to talk directly to each other in your home. Some smart devices, especially smart bulbs and light switches, come with a gateway or &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; device that hooks to your home router to connect the device to your home network and the Internet, so you can control the device through a smartphone locally and remotely (Philips Hue, Lutron Cas&eacute;ta, and August locks are all popular products that use bridge devices). These bridges can enable compatibility with hub-free cloud platforms, like Nest or Apple HomeKit, as well as voice control via smart speakers like Amazon Alexa and Google Home.</p>\n<p>Finally, the popularity of digital assistants and smart speakers&mdash;chiefly <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/what-is-alexa-what-is-the-amazon-echo-and-should-you-get-one/\">Amazon Echo</a> and <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/google-home-voice-controlled-speaker/\">Google Home</a> devices, and to a lesser extent <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/apple-homepod/\">Apple HomePod</a>&mdash;has fundamentally changed the trajectory of the smart home. Though most smart speakers are technically controllers and not full-fledged smart hubs, we think for most people the difference isn&rsquo;t discernable. For instance, with a basic Amazon Echo you can pair devices from popular smart brands&mdash;August, Ecobee, Hue, Kwikset, Lutron, Nest, Ring, Skybell, Wemo, and so on&mdash;use the app to configure routines, and have the ability to trigger or control them using your voice.</p>\n<p>One noteworthy shortcoming of cloud-based platforms and smart speakers is a limited selection of sensors, such as contact sensors (for doors and windows) and room sensors (for air, temperature, and motion). On hub-based systems, these devices allow you to create complex and nuanced automations and security routines. On hubless systems, sensors are either Bluetooth-based, and thus limited to short-range use, or depend on Wi-Fi and thus burn through batteries relatively quickly (by comparison, Z-Wave&ndash; and Zigbee-based sensors can last for years on a coin-size battery).</p>\n<p>In practice, within an hour or so you could reasonably install and configure a few <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/22642/0/4/88373/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hue light bulbs</a>, a <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/21256/0/4/88374/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nest Thermostat</a>, and a <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/19511/0/4/88375/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ring Video Doorbell 2</a>. Using your choice of smart speaker, an Android phone with Google Assistant, or an iPhone and HomeKit, you could control each light individually or have them all go on or off simultaneously using your voice or an app. You can also create a scene so that when you go to bed at night you can touch an icon on your phone or even say &ldquo;nighty night&rdquo; and have the lights turn off, your thermostat drop to 65, and a speaker begin playing classical music. You can certainly dream up scenarios that aren&rsquo;t possible, and there are differences between what you can do between the various platforms but, in our experience, any one of these voice-controlled platforms will let most people do most of the things they&rsquo;d want with most popular smart devices&mdash;and even more than they&rsquo;d expect.</p>\n<p>\n\t<aside

hub</h3>\n<p>Smart-home enthusiasts looking for more fine-grained control, a wider range of products, and more complex automations may still prefer a dedicated hub. You may be in luck if you already have a home security system, particularly one of the more recent DIY systems like <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/25828/0/4/88376/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Abode</a> as well as some Alarm.com-compatible systems. These are basically smart-home hubs, but designed to emphasize home security. Many will support mesh-network protocols like Z-Wave or Zigbee along with some popular Wi-Fi&ndash;based devices.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, our favorite standalone hub is the <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/31290/0/4/88377/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung </a><a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/31290/0/4/88377/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SmartThings</a>. It supports a ton of standards and platforms (big names like ClearConnect, Z-wave Plus and Zigbee wireless, as well as Alexa and Google Assistant, among tons of others&mdash;<a href=\"https://www.smartthings.com/products\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here&rsquo;s a complete list</a>.) The basic $70 hub connects to your home network via Wi-Fi but Samsung offers a higher-end model, the <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/29748/0/4/88378/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SmartThings Wifi</a>, which combines a router and a hub. If it&rsquo;s paired with two or more units it acts as a mesh network that should eliminate wireless-free zones in your house&mdash;a common issue with smart-home gear.</p>\n<p>We connected a few SmartThings-branded sensors and devices. In just a minute or so we set up a motion sensor to send a notification to our smartphone (&ldquo;We got company!&rdquo;), turn on a Hue light, and activate a Sonos speaker, and it all worked quickly, too. You can also set up one or several devices to activate on demand as a scene, which is especially useful if you trigger it using voice via Alexa. In long-term use we suffered occasional service outages&mdash;a common issue with every hub we&rsquo;ve used&mdash;and encountered sporadic delays when trying to control a device or found that a device&rsquo;s status may be incorrect or delayed.</p>\n<p>The low-cost <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/23129/0/4/88379/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wink Hub 2</a> is another popular hub, due to its comprehensive support of wireless signals and smart platforms and its largely simple (if sometimes stilted) app. We also think the much less powerful but more mainstream <a class=\"product-link\" href=\"https://wclink.co/link/30492/0/4/88380/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Echo Plus</a> smart speaker could be a good fit for some people because it natively supports Zigbee wireless sensors and devices, such as Hue lights. The companion Alexa app is required to set things up and isn&rsquo;t as useful or versatile as other smart-home apps, but for anyone who wants the convenience of voice control, the Echo is ideal, affordable, and great sounding, too.</p>\n<p>As a category, smart hubs experience frequent-enough failures, outages, and hairpull-inducing anomalies that we think they simply aren&rsquo;t a great fit for the average non-techie person. Buy a home hub and you are signing on for midnight-hour-troubleshooting and scouring support pages and community forums in the hopes of locating the elusive solution to a nagging problem. You will inevitably want to do something that you can&rsquo;t&mdash;unless you pay a visit to <a href=\"https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/SmartThingsPublic\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>, where you can find developer tools and forums dedicated to smart-home enthusiasts. But in the right hands, with a smart hub you&rsquo;ll have earned the potential to create a refined and holistic smart-home experience that&rsquo;s not otherwise possible without a professional install.</p>\n\n",

      "rendered": "<p>We recommend several Nest products at Wirecutter, along with many devices that work with them, and that integration is often crucial to how people use their devices. But the <a href=\"https://www.the-ambient.com/news/works-with-nest-shut-down-google-assistant-1583\" target=\"_blank\">recent news that Google is folding Nest into its smart-home ecosystem</a> and creating Google Nest means that major changes&mdash;some good, some painful&mdash;are coming. Here is what you need to know about these changes and what steps you can take.</p>\n<h3>What will happen to my Nest devices?</h3>\n<p>Works with Nest (WWN) is the invisible pathway that connects your Nest devices to other smart-home gadgets without the need for a hub, letting you create cool and useful automations in your home. Google announced that it would be ending <a href=\"https://workswith.nest.com\" target=\"_blank\">WWN</a> and launching Works with Google Assistant in its place. After public outcry, the company reversed course on plans to scuttle WWN on August 31 and instead is leaving the transition period open-ended. For now, while Google works to expand Google Assistant integrations, the company says existing WWN integrations will continue to function for an unknown duration. </p>\n<p>All Nest devices&mdash;including the Learning Thermostat, the Protect smoke alarm, Nest cameras, the Nest Secure system, the Nest Hello video doorbell, and the Nest &times; Yale Lock&mdash;will continue to work together through Nest&rsquo;s app, and with Google&rsquo;s devices through methods such as voice control with a Google Mini, Max, or Nest Hub (formerly known as the Home Hub). One important caveat, though: If you buy a new Nest device after August 31, 2019, you will need to set it up with a Google account, and once you move to Google all of your WWN integrations will stop working. This means, for example, that if you usually use your Nest thermostat to tell your <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/25845/0/4/93773/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SimpliSafe</a> alarm system when you are away, or your Nest Cam to turn on your <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/18384/0/4/93774/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WeMo</a>-connected lights when it sees a person, you will no longer be able to do that. </p>\n\n\t<aside class=\"inline-recirc\">\n\t\t<h4 class=\"recirc-title\">More smart-home ideas</h4>\n\t\t<ul class=\"recirc-list\">\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"section-posts-list-item js-post-list-item recirc-list-item\">\n\t\t<article class=\"article-group js-article-group\" data-url=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/do-you-need-a-smart-home-hub/\" data-title=\"Do You Need a Smart-Home Hub?\" data-content-type=\"post\" aria-labelledby=\"group-title-83668\" aria-describedby=\"group-text-83668\" tabindex=\"0\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/do-you-need-a-smart-home-hub/\" class=\"image-link\" role=\"presentation\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/smarthubs-lowres-1080333-120x80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/smarthubs-lowres-1080333-630x420.jpg 630w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/smarthubs-lowres-1080333-570x380.jpg 570w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/smarthubs-lowres-1080333-330x220.jpg 330w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/smarthubs-lowres-1080333-200x134.jpg 200w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/smarthubs-lowres-1080333-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"\" alt=\"Do You Need a Smart-Home Hub?\" class=\"lazyload image lazyload image\" data-amp-layout=\"responsive\" role=\"presentation\">\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"group\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a id=\"group-title-83668\" class=\"headline-link\" href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/do-you-need-a-smart-home-hub/\" aria-label=\"Do You Need a Smart-Home Hub?\">Do You Need a Smart-Home Hub?</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"group-text-83668\" class=\"summary\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A hub connects otherwise-incompatible smart-home devices but for most people they&rsquo;re no longer necessary&mdash;Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri do the job fine.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</article>\n\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"section-posts-list-item js-post-list-item recirc-list-item\">\n\t\t<article class=\"article-group js-article-group\" data-url=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/how-to-protect-your-smart-home-from-hackers/\" data-title=\"How to Protect Your Smart Home From Hackers\" data-content-type=\"post\" aria-labelledby=\"group-title-85536\" aria-describedby=\"group-text-85536\" tabindex=\"0\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"thumb\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/how-to-protect-your-smart-home-from-hackers/\" class=\"image-link\" role=\"presentation\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190311_smart-home-protection-630-120x80.png\" data-srcset=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190311_smart-home-protection-630.png 630w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190311_smart-home-protection-630-570x380.png 570w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190311_smart-home-protection-630-330x220.png 330w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190311_smart-home-protection-630-200x134.png 200w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20190311_smart-home-protection-630-120x80.png 120w\" sizes=\"\" alt=\"How to Protect Your Smart Home From Hackers\" class=\"lazyload image lazyload image\" data-amp-layout=\"responsive\" role=\"presentation\">\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"group\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a id=\"group-title-85536\" class=\"headline-link\" href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/blog/how-to-protect-your-smart-home-from-hackers/\" aria-label=\"How to Protect Your Smart Home From Hackers\">How to Protect Your Smart Home From Hackers</a>\n\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"group-text-85536\" class=\"summary\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Smart home devices can make life more convenient, but may put you at risk of being hacked. Ensure your safety with a few simple measures.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</article>\n\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</aside>\n\t\n<h3>Will I still be able to use Alexa with my Nest devices?</h3>\n<p>Yes, you&rsquo;ll still be able to use Alexa&mdash;probably. Although Amazon hasn&rsquo;t officially announced whether it will migrate to Works With Google Assistant, Nest has a note on its Alexa support page saying that there will be <a href=\"https://nest.com/support/article/Nest-and-Amazon-Alexa?tag=823814-20\" target=\"_blank\">no change to functionality with Alexa</a>: &ldquo;We are working with Amazon to migrate the Nest skill on Amazon Alexa to ensure a smooth transition for Nest customers prior to winding down the Works With Nest program in August.&rdquo; No details have been released, but we suggest that you periodically check for updates to your Alexa app. </p>\n<h3>What do I have to do?</h3>\n<p>For now, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything. Nest owners will soon receive an email from Google asking them to migrate their Nest account to a Google account. As soon as you migrate to a Google account, all of your WWN integrations will stop working&mdash;so if you want to keep using current Nest automations, don&rsquo;t migrate until you have to. Once you do, be sure to check out the <a href=\"https://assistant.google.com/explore?hl=en_us&amp;utm_source=assistant-original&amp;utm_campaign=learn-experiment&amp;utm_medium=assistant-site&amp;jsmode=du\" target=\"_blank\">Works With Google Assistant</a> site to see how to integrate your Nest devices with Google, and what other systems are currently compatible. </p>\n<h3>Do I have to go Google?</h3>\n<p>No, you don&rsquo;t have to opt in to using a Google account. You can stay with Nest and be governed by <a href=\"https://t.co/33UJZv6HEq\" target=\"_blank\">Nest&rsquo;s TOS and privacy statements</a> (not <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">Google&rsquo;s</a>). Going that route, however, means you won&rsquo;t get any new smart-home integrations, which Google says will be coming. Additionally, as some features (such as managing your Nest Aware subscription) will be only in the Google Home app after the migration, you&rsquo;ll have to use the Nest.com website to manage yours if you don&rsquo;t migrate. Anyone who signs up a Nest device after the Google and Nest apps migrate won&rsquo;t have that choice and will automatically start with a Google account.</p>\n<h3>Will my other smart-home devices work with Nest products?</h3>\n<p>Some will work and some won&rsquo;t. Following the transition from WWN to Works With Google Assistant, manufacturers will have to go through Google&rsquo;s developer program for their devices to work with Nest. Google says it will be far more selective than in the past about which devices it will allow on the platform, and even if it accepts a device, the integrations won&rsquo;t be as robust as on WWN. For instance, some third-party devices won&rsquo;t be able to read data from a Nest device or change its status. (Google says it will enable the ability to trigger routines for some devices based on home/away status &ldquo;later this year.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>To get an idea of what that means, if your smart lighting, say, is set to turn off when your Nest thermostat goes into away mode, that functionally could disappear if the lighting manufacturer doesn&rsquo;t move to WWGA. Similarly, smart locks won&rsquo;t set your Nest to home or away when the lock is opened or closed. And third-party apps that integrate Nest devices, as well as smart-home hubs, will no longer have access to that data. Google has also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18537331/google-nest-cancellation-assistant-smart-home-integration-report\" target=\"_blank\">said it will not support IFTTT going forward</a>, nor any other service or device that doesn&rsquo;t fit with its views of privacy and security in the smart home. IFTTT has <a href=\"https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022524734\" target=\"_blank\">posted an update</a> in this regard.</p>\n<aside class=\"pullquote\"><p>Google says it will be far more selective than in the past about which devices it will allow on the platform, and even if it accepts a device, the integrations won&rsquo;t be as robust as on WWN.</p></aside>\n<p>Google says restricting non-Nest devices is intended to keep your data more private and secure.

      "rendered": "<p>Smart-home devices don&rsquo;t just make it easier to close the garage door or secure your home. They can also help you save energy and money, if you use them properly. And seeing how <a href=\"https://www.erc-co.org/spooky-statistics-about-energy-and-water-waste/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Americans spend $130 billion a year on wasted energy</a>, people can use all the help they can get.</p>\n<p>You set up smart-home devices using a smartphone, and you can control them remotely, put them on a schedule, connect them to a smart speaker, or even set them up to perform actions on their own. By giving you more control over the things in your home that use energy, smart-home devices can be part of an energy-saving plan. Here are a few ways to use smart-home devices to cut down on energy and water waste while also saving money.</p>\n<h2>To turn off lights</h2>\n<p>When someone in my house leaves the lights on, I can almost feel my energy bill going up. (Maybe it&rsquo;s just my blood pressure.) Smart lighting foils energy hogs by adding remote control, scheduling, and automation to an everyday fixture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smart-led-light-bulbs/\">Smart bulbs</a> are the simplest way to save money because all you have to do is screw in a light bulb. And all smart bulbs are LED bulbs, which use up to <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/save-electricity-and-fuel/lighting-choices-save-you-money/led-lighting\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">75 percent less energy</a> than incandescents yet last 25 times longer. They also bring extra savings by adding dimming, which can <a href=\"https://www.lampsplus.com/ideas-and-advice/how-dimmers-save-energy/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">save another 40 percent</a>. Smart bulbs can trigger in reaction to other smart devices, motion sensors, or your location (aka geofencing), so they&rsquo;ll operate efficiently without your needing to be there to turn them off. We like the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/22642/0/4/93486/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Philips Hue</a> line, which offers a number of smart-bulb kits for both inside and outside the home.</p>\n\n\t<figure id=\"attachment_92879\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n\t\t<div class=\"chapter__arp-image\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-92879 lazyload image\" alt=\"A smart phone with the Philips Hue app open next to a blue, glowing smart bulb.\" width=\"636\" height=\"424\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" data-src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981.jpg\" src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981-120x80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981.jpg 636w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981-630x420.jpg 630w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981-570x380.jpg 570w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981-330x220.jpg 330w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981-200x134.jpg 200w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smartLEDbulbs-lowres-0981-120x80.jpg 120w\"></div>\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n\t\t\tYou can configure Philips Hue smart bulbs to work with a host of other devices.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit\"> Photo: Michael Hession</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n\n\t\n<p>Another option, for the person who knows how to wire an outlet, is a <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-in-wall-wireless-light-switch-and-dimmer/\">smart in-wall light switch</a>, which replaces your existing light switch to control lighting fixtures.

A smart plug offers an inexpensive way to control lights: Our longtime favorite, the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/18384/0/4/93488/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Wemo Mini</a>, costs under $30 per lamp.

We recommend the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/26514/0/4/93491/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rachio 3 Smart Sprinkler Controller</a> because it uses hyper-local Web-based weather information to adjust schedules automatically, so you won&rsquo;t be one of those people who water their lawn right before (or during) a rainstorm. If you don&rsquo;t have an in-ground sprinkler system, a <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/32433/0/4/93492/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">smart faucet controller</a> works for standard sprinklers or soaker hoses.</p>\n<h2>To curb cooling and heating</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=36692\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">US Energy Information Administration</a> says that the largest single use of electricity by US households is in fans and air conditioning, with some households spending more than $525 a year. A <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-thermostat/\">smart thermostat</a> optimizes your home&rsquo;s heating and cooling so that you never waste electricity or fuel. Our pick, the <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-thermostat/\">Nest Thermostat E</a>, is a learning thermostat that can automatically adjust temperatures to optimal levels based on your habits, the location, and the time it takes to cool your home. When you leave home, it adjusts the temperature so you aren&rsquo;t blasting the AC or heat all day. And it turns the system back on before you get home, so in the summer you don&rsquo;t arrive to an oven (and regret being energy-conscious). If you don&rsquo;t have central air, either a <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-air-conditioner/#other-types-of-air-conditioners\">smart air conditioner</a> or a standard window unit with a smart plug can give you additional control so you&rsquo;re not wasting cool air when no one is home to appreciate it.</p>\n\n\t<figure id=\"attachment_92882\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n\t\t<div class=\"chapter__arp-image\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-92882 lazyload image\" alt=\"A Nest Thermostat E set to 76 degrees.\" width=\"636\" height=\"424\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" data-src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2.jpg\" src=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2-120x80.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2.jpg 636w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2-630x420.jpg 630w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2-570x380.jpg 570w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2-330x220.jpg 330w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2-200x134.jpg 200w, https://thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smart-thermostats-Nest-E-lowres-2-120x80.jpg 120w\"></div>\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n\t\t\tThe Nest Thermostat E makes adjusting your home&rsquo;s temperature easy.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit\"> Photo: Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n\n\t\n<p>A smart ceiling fan can be another great option. The <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/home-cooling-systems/fans-cooling\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">US Department of Energy</a> says ceiling fans let you raise thermostats about 4 degrees without noticing a difference. And smart fans like those from <a href=\"https://www.bigassfans.com/fans/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Big Ass Fans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hunterfan.com/ceiling-fan-smart-home\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hunter</a> include motion sensors so they run only when you&rsquo;re in the room; they can also integrate with a thermostat to maximize savings (note that we haven&rsquo;t tested such models yet). Or, instead of going for a smart fan, consider the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/32434/0/4/93494/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lutron Cas&eacute;ta Smart Fan Control</a>, which works with <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/ceiling-fan-i-always-get/\">most existing fans</a> (it requires the <a href=\"https://wclink.co/link/15788/0/4/93495/\" class=\"product-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Cas&eacute;ta Smart Bridge</a>) and can respond to triggers from an app or other smart devices such as thermostats or temperature sensors. And if a ceiling fan just isn&rsquo;t a good fit, a <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-fan/\">room fan</a> with a <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smart-switch/\">smart plug</a> can be an easy and affordable option too.</p>\n<p>A lot of heat passes through windows, resulting in overheating in the summer and <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/energy-efficient-window-attachments\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">heat loss</a> in the winter. Shades can help prevent that, but smart shades, although expensive to install, can make it easier. Set either at specific times or on schedules, smart shades and blinds (by companies such as <a href=\"https://www.hunterdouglas.com/operating-systems/motorized/powerview-motorization/overview\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hunter Douglas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18172043/ikea-smart-blinds-kadrilj-fyrtur-tradfi-home-connected-wifi-homekit-alexa-price\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IKEA</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.serenashades.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lutron</a>) can open and close to allow light (and energy) to pass though only when you want it.

Just plug in whichever energy hog you wish&mdash;your old plasma TV, an audio system, a space heater&mdash;and schedule the strip to cut the power completely when the device isn&rsquo;t in use.

Additionally, although these models are reliant on pairing with your iPhone for calls, texts, and other data features, they can track your running with internal GPS circuitry if you leave your phone at home. For full independence from your iPhone, you&rsquo;d need to opt for <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smartwatch-iphone/#for-connectivity-without-your-phone-apple-watch-series-4-or-apple-watch-nike-with-cellular\">our upgrade pick</a>, the Apple Watch Series 4 (with cellular), which isn&rsquo;t on sale.</p>\n<p>We still consider the 2017 Apple Watch Series 3 a good value, and Walmart has both the 38 mm and 42 mm models at healthy discounts.
